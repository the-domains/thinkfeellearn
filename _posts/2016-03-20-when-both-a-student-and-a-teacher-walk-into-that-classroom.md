## Rethinking How We Experience School with Heart Centered Education

When both a student and a teacher walk into that classroom, they bring with them their lifetime of  feelings, relationships and knowledge.  Days, years, and whole lives enter those doors.

We know that schools are complex social environments.  How are our teachers and students navigating them? Do we keep ignoring what each individual brings and press forward with the daily agenda?  What happens when student's lives spill over and interfere with the academic agenda?  It becomes a lose-lose situation for all.  It doesn't have to be.

_S_ocio-emotional literacy no longer needs to be the hidden curriculum in our schools. There can be an integrated approach that allows us all to learn and thrive. But we need a set of tools and strategies and a concious intention to move in that direction.  We continue to battle persistant bullying, one size fits all solutions and teacher fatigue.  Let's change that.  Let's create a new paradigm that is people centered, where the focus of learning includes creating a thriving socio-emotional culture that learns and grows together.  We invite you to join us in creating it.

_Think. Feel. Learn._
